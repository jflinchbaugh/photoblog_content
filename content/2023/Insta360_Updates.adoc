I continue to
link:{site_context}2023/Workflow_for_360_Video.html[use the Insta360]
on my bicycle
and the Android app
to process the video.

The application is getting much better
with each recent update:

* It's started exporting
  from the phone up to 1440p.
* I don't think I've seen any crashes
  for a while.
* When building a story,
  I can select
  the max number
  of clips to import,
  and when I come
  back for more,
  _it now indicates which
  were already imported_,
  so I can easily
  find the remaining clips.
* I just found a selector
  that allows me to choose "HD"
  or "Quick" preview
  while working with the video.
