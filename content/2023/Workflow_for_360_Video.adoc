I've been using the Insta360 X3
for a https://www.youtube.com/@JohnFlinchbaugh/videos[couple months],
and I'm settling
into an optimal workflow
for processing all the video
on my phone.
Initially,
I'd shoot hours of video straight
and try to edit it,
but this offered _lots_
of challenges:

* It requires a very large SD card.
* It burns lots of battery.
* It leaves me with hours of video to review and process.
* Hours of video in Insta360's mobile app cause slowdown
  and crashes when editing a huge "Story".

Currently I've been taking the recent approach:

* I mount the camera
  on the selfie stick attached
  to my bicycle handlebars
  or a strap on my chest,
  since I'm not good at riding
  and holding the camera by hand.
  This gives me the look
  of a drone flying ahead of me.
* I run USB power to the camera
  from a power bank
  to keep the camera running
  longer than 45 minutes.
  The cable runs down the side
  of the camera,
  so mostly disappears
  in the stitch line.
* I only capture the interesting bits.
  I put the camera in "Loop Recording" mode keeping 1-minute clips.
  When I see something I want to keep,
  I stop the recording to keep the loop of the last minute or 2,
  and I'll immediately restart the recording.
  This leaves me with usually 20-40 small clips.
* I leave the gigabytes of video on the camera,
  and connect the mobile app running on my phone
  to the camera via Bluetooth and WiFi Direct.
* I process each small clip from oldest to newest:
** I open each individual clip,
  and I see if there's anything there worth keeping.
  I delete it if I don't recognize anything notable,
  so I don't need to process it later.
** For the bit in the file that's worth keeping,
  I reframe it in the app.
** Then I aggressively trim
  the video to be 4-20 seconds long
  using the "jump cut" feature
  in the trim tool.
* Once all the clips are ready,
  I create a new "Story"
  and start adding batches
  of short clips in chronological order.
  They're already trimmed and reframed,
  so I see how the clips flow,
  and trim or delete even further,
  and maybe add a transition or two between clips.
* After many passes of trimming the clips
  that comprise a story,
  I can export the resulting video,
  usually only a few minutes in length,
  to the filesystem
  on the phone.

I try to keep the videos
as short as possible,
since no one wants to watch
a boring 20 minutes.
I'll also likely export
a single clip or two
as highlights to upload
