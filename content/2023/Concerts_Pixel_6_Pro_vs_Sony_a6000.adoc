I've been photographing
clubs, local concerts,
and everything else
in an amateur capacity
with my array of Sony a6000 cameras
for over 8 years.
That camera technology is old
but it serves me well.

I've also been photographing
more recently
with my Pixel 6 Pro.
The 3 lenses of different focal length
and the digital zoom
are surprisingly capable.
The software
does a really nice job
cleaning up noise
in low light
most the time
or picking the cleanest shot
of a sequence.

Below I show 2 photos
from the real camera
and 2 images
from the phone.
Looking close
on a big screen,
I can tell the difference,
but it's pretty good.
Having seen how
the phone deals
with image noise,
I learned
I can get away
with some heavier noise reduction
in my camera images.
